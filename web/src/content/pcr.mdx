# pcr

## primers
- the most critical step in PCR is designing the proper **primers**
- need both a **forward** and **reverse** primer
    - if you only have one, then you only get linear amplification, rather than geometric amplification (think: only forward or reverse primer = _always 1 template strand_, no matter how many complementary strands are synthesized!)

## pcr master mix
- usually includes
    - DNA polymerase (Taq)
    - dNTPs
    - cofactor
        - most often <C chem="\ce{MgCl2}" />
        - for some enzymes, <C chem="\ce{MgSO4}" /> is used instead
    - buffer
        - often purchased as 10X
            - 10X stock solution is one that contains ten times the concentration of all solutes relative to a working solution, i.e. dilution by factor of 10 is needed to obtain working solution
            - 1.5X concentration might increase PCR yield
        - sets the pH between 8.0 and 9.5
        - often includes
            - Tris-HCl (Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane hydrochloride)
            - potassium chloride: <C chem="\ce{KCl}" /> (promotes primer annealing)
            - magnesium chloride: <C chem="\ce{MgCl2}" />; influences the stringency of the interaction between the primers and template DNA
                - [magnesium chloride has dual uses: one as a cofactor for Taq, and another mediating primer binding specificity](https://archive.is/lNj7C)
                - Mg binds to phosphate groups of DNA and decreases repulsion between DNA strands, increasing primer binding
                - [too high Mg concentration can lead to high rates of non-specific primer binding](http://www.eeescience.utoledo.edu/faculty/sigler/Von_Sigler/LEPR_Protocols_files/PCR.pdf)
- components of master mix that need to be manually added
    - template
    - primers
    - [probes (fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides)](http://www.primerdesign.co.uk/assets/files/beginners_guide_to_real_time_pcr.pdf)
        - [hydrolysis (TaqMan) probes](https://www.bio-rad.com/en-us/applications-technologies/introduction-pcr-primer-probe-chemistries?ID=LUSOJW3Q3)
    - water
