# pcr

## primers
- the most critical step in PCR is designing the proper **primers**
- need both a **forward** and **reverse** primer
    - if you only have one, then you only get linear amplification, rather than geometric amplification (think: only forward or reverse primer = _always 1 template strand_, no matter how many complementary strands are synthesized!)

## pcr master mix
- usually includes
    - DNA polymerase (Taq)
    - dNTPs
    - <C chem="\ce{MgCl2}" />
    - buffer
